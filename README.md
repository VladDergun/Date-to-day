# Date-to-day

This program gets the date as input from the user in the format dd.mm.year and tells which day was on this date. The program doesn't use additional libraries for determining the date, hence the amount of code.

Limitations: Due to the usage of a primitive formula set by our university, this program can only calculate the day accurately up to the year 2099. 
Hence the in-code limitations.
